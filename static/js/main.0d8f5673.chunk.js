This area has lower gravity than other regions, and a 2007 study finds that now-melted glaciers are to blame.The ice that once cloaked the area during the last ice age has long since melted, but the Earth hasn't entirely snapped back from the burden. Since gravity over an area is proportional to the mass atop that region, and the glacier's imprint pushed aside some of the Earth's mass, gravity is a bit less strong in the ice sheet's imprint. The slight deformation of the crust explains 25 percent to 45 percent of the unusually low gravity; the rest may be explained by a downward drag caused the motion of magma in Earth's mantle (the layer just beneath the crust), researchers reported in the journal Science."}].map((function(e){var t=e.title,a=e.subtitle;return i.a.createElement("div",{key:a,ref:ie,id:"fun-facts-id",className:"paragraph"},i.a.createElement("h1",null,t),i.a.createElement("p",null,a))}))),i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement("div",{id:"France-id"},i.a.createElement(m,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"US-id"},i.a.createElement(p,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"China-id"},i.a.createElement(g,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Spain-id"},i.a.createElement(f,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Italy-id"},i.a.createElement(y,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Turkey-id"},i.a.createElement(b,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"UK-id"},i.a.createElement(v,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Germany-id"},i.a.createElement(w,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Russia-id"},i.a.createElement(k,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Malaysia-id"},i.a.createElement(E,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Mexico-id"},i.a.createElement(T,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Austria-id"},i.a.createElement(A,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Hong-Kong-id"},i.a.createElement(S,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Ukraine-id"},i.a.createElement(C,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Thailand-id"},i.a.createElement(x,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Saudi-Arabia-id"},i.a.createElement(j,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Greece-id"},i.a.createElement(I,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Canada-id"},i.a.createElement(M,null)),i.a.createElement("div",{id:"Poland-id"},i.a.createElement(P,null))))},U=[];U.push("France"),U.push("United States"),U.push("China"),U.push("Spain"),U.push("Italy"),U.push("Turkey"),U.push("United Kingdom"),U.push("Germany"),U.push("Russia"),U.push("Malaysia"),U.push("Mexico"),U.push("Austria"),U.push("Hong Kong"),U.push("Ukraine"),U.push("Thailand"),U.push("Saudi Arabia"),U.push("Greece"),U.push("Canada"),U.push("Poland");a(43);var R=function(){return i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement(N,null))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));o.a.render(i.a.createElement(i.a.StrictMode,null,i.a.createElement(R,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}},[[26,1,2]]]);
